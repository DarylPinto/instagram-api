## Self Hosting

You can also opt to host your own instance of the API by following the steps below:

1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) (12.12.0 or higher)
2. [Download](https://github.com/DarylPinto/instagram-api/archive/self-hosted.zip) the repo on the `self-hosted` branch
3. `cd` into the repo directory
4. `npm install` (This may take a few minutes - be patient)
5. `npm start`
6. Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser

Optionally, settings can be tweaked in `api/config.json`

## Limitations

* Only supports `GET` requests on Instagram user pages (by design)
* Data only updates every 5 minutes (by design - for caching purposes)
* Only includes 12 most recent posts
